# Brief of background
In charge of developing the whole report generation module for a new system, going to explore, try, and test several report (excel/pdf) generation engines.

## User/Functional Requirements
The preliminary user/functional requirements were unclear, so I included many functionalities from basic to advanced that going for testing.

Then try to find the best suitable tools for generate Excel and/or PDF, it is not necessary to have a tool that can generate both Excel and pdf 
(I think that would be expensive if one contains almost all listed features and able to generate in Excel and PDF). 

A tool for Excel, a tool for PDF would also be accepted.

1.1 Common Content and Features
* Table, border
* Cell value, cell data type (date/time/numeric/text/image/URL)
* Font size, font family(font style), alignment
* Color, background-color
* Formula, formula function
* File meta, created by, create datetime, last saved by, last saved datetime

1.2. Advanced features
* Templating (how to implement something like mail merge/repeating table body, how easy to use) 
* Print area (page break for printing)
* Repeat Table header for printing
* Conditional Style (special color, style on condition)
* For PDF, embed custom font family file (TTF/OTF/WOFF/WOFF2/SVG) for styling the PDF text content

2. Performance
* Generate 100000 rows with plain text data
* Generate 100000 rows with formula(sub total, total) data

4. Security
* Generate file in memory stream, create file in computer physical storage (disk) is not preferred, alternative, delete the file on daily end
* Encrypt document (Require open password), if can't, alternative, compress in zip file, encrypt in zip layer
* Watermark
* For PDF, access right restriction (deny copy/print...)

P.S

In observation, the front-end JS libraries feature is limited and can't satisfy my needs compared to the library which is based on c#.
If you want a lite and the simplest report read/write function, just check out the below JavaScript/TypeScript listed library, those were not included in this project because this project is not focusing on the report read/write in front-end.

- parallax/jsPDF (write pdf)
- mozilla/pdf.js (read pdf)
- SheetJS (read/write excel)

# Demo
***Before you run (F5) on Visual Studio, make sure you read the "Installation" and complete the "Configuration"***
<br><br>
**If you want to test the Crystal Report**

change the startup project to "CoreSystemConsoleInNet"

**If you want to test others report engines**

change the startup project to "CoreSystemConsole"
<br><br>
Then, run (press F5) and wait its finish, the report should be generated and placed at the directory `tempRenderFolder`

# Configuration and setup

1. Control which reports you would like to test, comment and uncomment the lines in

> `SolutionRoot\CoreSystemConsole\Program.cs`

```
// Tick-off the Report Entity Program
//InvoiceProgram invoiceProgram = new InvoiceProgram();

//HitRateHTMLProgram hitRateHTMLProgram = new HitRateHTMLProgram();

//HitRateXMLProgram hitRateXMLProgram = new HitRateXMLProgram();

//EPPlus5XlsxTemplateProgram ePPlus5XlsxTemplateProgram = new EPPlus5XlsxTemplateProgram();

ITextGroupIPdfTemplateProgram iTextGroupIText5PdfTemplateProgram = new ITextGroupIPdfTemplateProgram();
```

2. Control the report generate folder, open and edit

> `SolutionRoot\CoreReport\VisualizationEntity.cs`

```
protected string tempRenderFolder = @"D:\\Temp"; // report will be generated in this directory
```


# Installation
<code style="color : red">If you have time before all you start</code>

$${\color{red}Read \space the \space documentation \space in \space "Develop \space Guide" \space Folder}$$

Some engines develop under pure C# and/or libraries, components already installed by NuGet Package Manager

except some of those rely on the external executable program like JAVAâ€¦

for examples, JasperReport, Crystal Report, EPPlus, Open XML need to install 3rd party SDK / library to make it work

to save the time, just right click on the project on VS Solution Explorer, select unload the project<br>
For CoreSystemConsole, remove the project under Dependencies > Projects to ignore in build<br>
For CoreSystemConsoleInNet, remove the project under Reference to ignore in build<br>

The installation beief are described in Wiki, please read "/Developer Guide/Developer Document.docx" for the details
