# Brief of background
I am in charge to develop the whole report generation module of a new system, I am going to explore, try and test several report (excel/pdf) generation engines.

# Scope of this repository
Try and error for study how to implmenet report(xlsx, pdf) generation in C# .net Core5

## Back end engine/tools
- Crystal Report (excel, pdf) (Implemented)
- Jasper Report (excel, pdf) (Implemented)
- EPPlus (excel) (Implemented)
- iText (pdf) (Implemented)
- Puppeteer (pdf) (Implemented)
- IronPDF for .net (pdf) (Implemented)
- OpenXmlSDK (excel) (too complicated, I give up)

## Front end engine/tools
The front end JS libraries feature is limited and can't satify my needs compare to the library which is based on c# in my observation.
If you want a lite and the simplest report read/write function, just check out below listed library, those were not included in this project becuase this project is not focus on the report read/write in front end.

- parallax/jsPDF (write pdf)
- mozilla/pdf.js (read pdf)
- SheetJS (read/write excel)

# Demo
***Before you run (F5) on Visual Studio, make sure you read the "Installation" and completed the "Configuration"***
<br><br>
**If you want to test the Crystal Report**

change the startup project to "CoreSystemConsoleInNet"

**If you want to test others report engines**

change the startup project to "CoreSystemConsole"
<br><br>
Then, run (press F5) and wait its finish, the report should be generated and placed at the directory `tempRenderFolder`

# Configuration and setup

1. Control which reports you would like to test, comment and uncomment the lines in

> `SolutionRoot\CoreSystemConsole\Program.cs`

```
// Tick-off the Report Entity Program
//InvoiceProgram invoiceProgram = new InvoiceProgram();

//HitRateHTMLProgram hitRateHTMLProgram = new HitRateHTMLProgram();

//HitRateXMLProgram hitRateXMLProgram = new HitRateXMLProgram();

//EPPlus5XlsxTemplateProgram ePPlus5XlsxTemplateProgram = new EPPlus5XlsxTemplateProgram();

ITextGroupIPdfTemplateProgram iTextGroupIText5PdfTemplateProgram = new ITextGroupIPdfTemplateProgram();
```

2. Control the report generate folder, open and edit

> `SolutionRoot\CoreReport\VisualizationEntity.cs`

```
protected string tempRenderFolder = @"D:\\Temp"; // report will be generated in this directory
```


# Installation

Some engines installation is not required, because those library develop under pure C# and already installed by NuGet Package Manager

Some report installation is required, because those library rely on the external executable program like JAVAâ€¦

for examples, JasperReport and Crystal Report need to install

The installation steps details are described below

## Crystal Report

# Conclusion
In general speaking, declear you need, excel or pdf or both, read or write or both

the generation approach listed below:

For excel

- front end, use javascript to generate xlsx (in xml format), less implement time, hard to do comprehensive layout
- back end, framework/engine providing a design tool to design and save the layout as a template, allowed to feed the data set(s) to template, to 
- back end, having a template excel in back end, read and copy the template then fill your data in the cell by row/column

For pdf

- front end/back end, use javascript to call pdf api, create pdf components with coordinate (width, height, x, y), hard to handle comprehensive layout
- front end, use canvas HTML element to capture the a specific area of screen in browser and print as a pdf
- front end, use javascript to call browser print function to print your page as a pdf
- back end, convert a excel to pdf
- back end, convert html (maybe with limited css) to pdf

## For excel manipulation read/write (xlsx, xls)
After the test, I rank the tool from 1 to bigger number, 1 is the most perferable.
1. EPPlus5, api is straight forward, easy to understand and use, implemented excel like behaviors, most advcanced features (chart, pivot table, header, footer, print number, cell validation..etc), support xlsx
2. Jasper Report, Java based program, officia provide a c# wrapped for call support xlsx, xls
3. OpenXmlSDK, microsoft provides basic API, required to read dehumanized, complex, extremely long documentation
4. Crystal Report, support xlsx, xls, bad excel generation because of the design, for details please read below 4 Urls

## For pdf manipulation write
After the test, I rank the tool from 1 to bigger number, 1 is the most perferable.
1. puppeteer/puppeteer, PejmanNik/puppeteer-report
2. Crystal Report
3. iText7
4. Jasper Report
